	<h3>Why do we need this kind of event?</h3>
  <p>We talk about the “leaky pipeline” a lot. It is the observed phenomenon that
    women leave tech 4x more often than their male counterparts and we don't talk
		about the retention rate of underrepresented minorities.
     The emphasis on talking about these issues instead of building up tech skills has negative
     impacts on an underrepresented minority's career in tech, as <a href = "http://www.colorado.edu/today/2016/04/11/women-nonwhite-execs-promote-diversity-their-own-detriment-says-cu-boulder-study">
     evidenced by research at the University of Colorado - Boulder </a>.
  </p>
  <p>Women and underrepresented minorities who have been working in technology for a while want to go to tech
    events to learn about technology, and especially about cool tech things done
     by people similar to them. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these events are targeted
     towards entry-level professionals. Recruitment is easier than retention,
     and it is evident that a demand is not being met for experienced female engineers.
     There is a desire for more from these WIT events. There needs to be more. </p>

  <p> The Ada Lovelace Conference is a conference that targets keeping mid-to-senior
    level engineers by giving them a chance to hone and share their skills.
    This conference doesn't cater to soft-skills or career panels, but instead
    is full of hands-on workshops where tech is the priority...and it just happens
    to be made by BAMF-ing people. </p>

  <p> Let's make. Let's create. </p>
